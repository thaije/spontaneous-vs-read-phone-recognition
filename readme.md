# Influence of input type on phone recognition using a CNN
This is a repository containing our files for our research: "What is the influence of input type (read vs. spontaneous) on phone recognition in a deep convolutional neural network". 
The research has been done for the masters course Advanced Research Methods from the Radboud University Nijmegen.
It is based on research of Danny Merkx.
